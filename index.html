        <p>Happy birthday, Shweta. I wish for your day to be soft with laughter and bright with moments that feel like gentle surprises. You deserve small, perfect things: warm tea, a song that makes you smile, and a sun that knows how to hold you gently.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="para fade" data-delay="600">
        <p>Your presence is quietly important — not loud like an announcement, but steady like a light left on for someone coming home. I notice the tiny ways you make ordinary things kinder: a laugh, a look, a patient answer. Those things stay with me longer than I expect.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="para fade" data-delay="1000">
        <p>You inspire me without meaning to. Watching you be yourself — calm, thoughtful, easy — teaches me to want better for my days. I don’t have a script or grand line to give you; I only have a wish: that you feel seen, that your happiness finds you always.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="para fade" data-delay="1400">
        <p>Today I celebrate you — the quiet light you bring and the small moments that become memories. May this year give you gentle courage, soft joy, and more reasons to smile. Happy birthday, Shweta — thank you for being you.</p>
